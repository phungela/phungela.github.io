  <p>Greetings visitor.</p>

  <p>Are you a business owner or an individual who would like to own his/her website?<br/>
     Would you like to attract more customers to your website or business online?</p>

  <p>If you answered 'yes' to these questions then you have come to the right place. <b>Phungela Online Solutions</b> is an
  online solutions provider that will ensure that your business is represented by a secure website of exceptional quality
  that your clients will be sure to love and enjoy. What is best about us is that our websites have <b>free hosting</b> 
  so no more high monthly hidden costs for web hosting for you so why don't you scroll down and take a look at what we offer...</p>
  
  <p>A website is essential to the growth of a business as billions of people are using the internet all
  over the world which means more potential clients for your business and what better way is there to connect with
  these potential clients than to refer them your company's own website? <b>Phungela Online Solutions</b> will give you the platform
  to connect with these potential clients by creating a secure website that your clients can use to get in touch with your business.</p>

  <p>We also offer the creation of advertising campaigns on Facebook whereby your business' advertisement will be
   posted on the news feeds of facebook users as a suggested post regardless of whether that person is your Facebook
   friend or not. This will give your business more exposure to Facebook users (a.k.a potential clients) who have never heard about your business before.</p>
