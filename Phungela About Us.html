  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p><img src="20190521_160343.jpg" alt="Ntsikelelo Mnqokoyi" style="float: left;width: 42px;height: 42px;border-radius:50%;"><b>Phungela Online Solutions</b> is an online solutions provider that aims to provide business owners from all walks of life an opportunity to take advantage of the global market of customers world-wide by representing their business online with a high quality, fully functional and secure ecommerce website.</p>


  <p>It was founded by a web design enthusiast who goes by the name of Ntsikelelo Mnqokoyi (pictured) who realised the importance of a website for businesses after seeing first-hand how powerful a website can be especially for business owners who want to sell their goods/services to the entire world, although a website will also work wonders for business owners who would only like to increase sales within their local region of operation.</p>

  <p>The name <b>Phungela</b> is derived from our founder's favorite ancestral clan name from his family's lineage</p>

  <p><b>Phungela Online Solutions</b> will make sure that your business has a website that your business and customers can be proud of so why don't you <a href="#">contact us</a> and find out more about this amazing opportunity.</p>
